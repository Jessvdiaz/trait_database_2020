Directions/ Data Management notes 

Step one: Combine/merge species lists to create a master's Species list of California Tree's and shrubs

Pepperwood, FIA data, North Bay species, and Chilean species 

Step 2: data cleaning- managing species names that are spelled or have different common names that will be used to query Try DB add common species in selected datasets for listed SPP.

Step 3: add second column of corrected species names to be able to pull from databases for traits 

Step 4: add/create trait data from our own personal data/ unpublished, look at data that Ackerly lab has published and crosscheck sources within Try DB 

Step 5: look at what trait data we have in DB common and uncommon.

Step 6: start to develop targeted traits for species

Step 7: index a database for use in our lab and Collaborator's analyses on commnuities.
