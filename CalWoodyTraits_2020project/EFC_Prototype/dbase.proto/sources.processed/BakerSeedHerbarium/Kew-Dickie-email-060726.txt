I would like to include Herb Baker's seed size data, and in fact I am in the process of bringing the entire set of cards back from Oregon and we will digitize all the rest of the traits. Since you also serve up the seed size data, and I obtained the excel file from you originally, I wanted to check that it is okay with you that we also put these data up on the Jepson Herbarium web site. I do feel it is important that Baker's data all be available through our databases, as well as through Kew. No problem, so long as SID (and thus Kew) is acknowledged somewhere - and I see that it is. This is kind of analagous with our relationship with LEDA-traitbase. We've fed in seed info on Europaean species via Renee Bekker and Ken Thompson, some of it already delivered by SID, and some not. We're not full-blown partners in the project, but we're acknowledged as data contributors. That suits me fine. Networks of partners can be a bit unwieldy, possibly why LEDA seems to be a bit behind schedule, though the first traits are now available.>You can see a prototype of the database at http://ucjeps.berkeley.edu/efc. The seed size data is up now and I will be presenting this publicly at the Botanical Society Meetings next week. Please let me know if you have questions or concerns, or if you would like additional attribution of the Kew database. I've had a very quick play, and it looks neat. As it stands, it's way easier to query than LEDA, and no registration, but I need to give both a fair trial. The proposed list of characters and states is impressive. Over the next few years there should be quite a few opportunities for more meta-analyses of th ekind you and Angela have been leading. Best of luck, and keep in touchJohn>-->David Ackerly>Department of Integrative Biology>3060 Valley Life Sciences Building>University of California, Berkeley>Berkeley, CA 94720-3140>tel: 510.643.6341 / fax: 510.643.6264>e: dackerly@berkeley.edu>http://ib.berkeley.edu/faculty/ackerlyd.html http://ib.berkeley.edu/labs/ackerly/index.html ***************************************************************************************** MILLENNIUM SEED BANK ProjectJohn Dickie, BA PhDHead of Information SectionSeed Conservation DepartmentRoyal Botanic Gardens, KewWakehurst Place, Ardingly, Haywards Heath West Sussex RH17 6TN, UKTel direct 	+ 44 - (0)1444 - 894115Fax direct 	+ 44 - (0)1444 - 894110Email:		j.dickie@rbgkew.org.ukhttp://www.rbgkew.org.uk/seedbank/msb.html
