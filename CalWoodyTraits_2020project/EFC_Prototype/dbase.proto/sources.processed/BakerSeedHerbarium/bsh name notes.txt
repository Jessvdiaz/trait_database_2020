All names checked against TJM
D. Ackerly; 7/17/06
Following changes made:

var changed to ssp and vice versa

any name indexed in TJM as a synonym was changed

obvious spelling mistakes, and fem/mas endings, corrected

if Baker listed as binomial, and TJM only recognizes one taxon in CA which has ssp. or var. status, then name was expanded to match TJM

if no subspp taxa are recognized, and Baker lists one, then binomial is used.

?taxa were corrected but have not been added
